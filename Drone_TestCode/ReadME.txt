A big thank you to all the different open source resources that I used to help develop this project (See the useful links file) 
To upload the project, Make sure that the UltraSonic Sensor is NOT CONNECTED. This is because they use D0 and D1 (RX, TX).
Program the Flight Controller using an ICSP Programmer.
